# Running the Frontend (client)

## Required downloads

beforehand, make sure to download nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/download

I recommend version 20.16 (LTS).

Once installed, you can do the following:

## Downloading and running the project

go to the client directory and run the following commands in the terminal of your IDE (probably vscode):

- npm i 

npm i is used to install all dependencies locally into your computer into a folder called node_modules

- npm run dev

runs the app

The client should be running on http://localhost:5173/
