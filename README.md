# Running the Frontend (client)
BEFORE HAND MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD NODE.JS: https://nodejs.org/en/download 
I recommend version 20.16 (LTS). 
Once installed, you can do the following: 
 
go to the client directory and run the folloiwing commands in the terminal of your IDE (probably vscode): 
npm i 
npm run dev 
 
The client should be running on http://localhost:5173/
